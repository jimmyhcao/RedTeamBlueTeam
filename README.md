# Home Lab Project - CyberLab Warfare: Red Team vs. Blue Team Battle

Welcome to my "Home Lab Project - CyberLab Warfare" repository! This project is all about creating a controlled environment for testing and improving my cybersecurity skills. In this lab, I simulate a Red Team vs. Blue Team battle using VMware and various cybersecurity tools. Below, I'll give you an overview of the lab setup and the smaller projects within it.

## Lab Configuration

### Virtualization Platform
- VMware: I use VMware as my virtualization platform to create and manage virtual machines.

### Network Configuration
- **pfsense**: It acts as my firewall and router, providing network security and routing for the lab.

### Operating Systems
- **Kali Linux**: My go-to platform for penetration testing and ethical hacking.
- **Security Onion**: A fantastic network security monitoring (NSM) and intrusion detection system (IDS).
- **Windows Server**: I use this for various purposes, such as Active Directory or other Windows-centric services.
- **Windows 10**: My target machine for various Red Team operations.
- **Ubuntu Server**: Another target machine for Red Team operations.

### Security Tools
- **Splunk**: A robust platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data.
- Other cybersecurity tools: I may use tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, or Nmap as well.

### Vulnerable Machines
- These are intentionally vulnerable machines that I'll attempt to compromise as the Red Team, while the Blue Team defends.
- Here, I'll list the specific vulnerable machines I've set up and provide relevant information about them.
